# TODOS

Priorities [ _1, _2, _3 | x: done, skip: ~~strikethrough~~ ]

- [_2] use 'targets' to attach the event listener to besides the 'window'

- [_2] limit a key match to a specific number of times. Example: match 'Control + a' 3x
Use pressed stat.

- [_1] delay Keylani.bind in order to handle bindings that start with the same key e.g: 'p' and 'p + 1'
